Challenges
I had a lot of difficulties installing React and Vite in my command prompt, however I understoof how to do it after the instructions gave me the Windows' Users Command. I also had some errors getting the profile to go on the local host, since I accidentally deleted all of the react and vite files. I had to install React and Vite again and the follow the steps accordingly. Meanwhile, the code was easy to do.
